# Custom appointment form with modified behavior


<p>This example illustrates how the appointment form can be customized to meet the following requirements:</p><p>All-Day event is the default and start & end times are hidden until the user unchecks the AllDay box at which point the time editors should be displayed. Default start time is 8:00 and end time - 17:00. <br />
If the All Day Event box is unchecked in the appointment editing form, the users should be automatically routed to Day View.<br />
Different types of appointments should be color coded, e.g. employee vacation and personal time off requested.  Those appointments that have not yet been approved by management should be highlighted.</p><p>Solution:<br />
A custom appointment form is constructed. To implement check/uncheck logic, client-side methods of the corresponding controls are used (<a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxClassesScriptsASPxClientControl_SetVisibletopic">SetVisible</a>). New appointment is initialized to All-Day by default via the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxSchedulerASPxScheduler_InitNewAppointmenttopic">InitNewAppointment</a> event. To change the active view to the Day View after a save command is executed, the <strong>FinalizeExecute()</strong> method of a custom MyAppointmentSaveCallbackCommand, inherited from the <strong>AppointmentFormSaveCallbackCommand</strong>, is overridden.<br />
To indicate different appointment types, custom labels and status are used.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong><br />
